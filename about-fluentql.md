fluentTQL is a taint-flow query specification language that is Java-like, with a fluent-interface design. The taint-flow queries written in fluentTQL model the data flow between relevant API calls from the analyzed code. The queries can express various taint-style vulnerability types, e.g. injections, cross-site scripting or path traversal. The language is implemented on top of Xtext and a taint analysis is implemented on top of Soot and Boomerang.
